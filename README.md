It is my first website created using basic HTML, focusing on simplicity and functionality. It featured a straightforward structure, using basic tags like `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, and basic formatting elements like headings, paragraphs, and lists, etc. The site included text content with no CSS or JavaScript, relying solely on HTML for layout and structure. I used hyperlinks for navigation between pages and inserted images using the `<img>` tag. The overall design was minimal, but it helped me understand the foundational elements of web development, setting the stage for learning more advanced techniques.
